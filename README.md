# PortWebsite
This is my personal website that I created using React framework. This design and creation was heavily inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fYi8SGA20k video. This was a way for me to learn about React and how to use their 3D items within the creation of websites.

Also Inspired from this GitHub Repo: https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_3D_developer_portfolio
